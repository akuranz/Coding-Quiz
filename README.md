HighScores.html retrieves the scores from local storage and allows users to clear highscores and return to the stat of the quiz.


## Javascript 
The Javascript relies on event listeners to modify the html dynamically based on user interaction. The quesitons are saved in a separate javascript file. Working on loading new scripts with new questions dynamically to the front page. No JQuery was used.
