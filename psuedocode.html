Step 1: Build landing page with call-to-action to start the quiz, 
        //instuction for the quiz in a div
        //timer in the left top corner (nav bar?)
        //and view high scores option in the top right corner (nav bar?)
        //name it startQuiz.html
        //link to bootstrap and javascript

Step 2: When CTA button is clicked,
        //starts timer, logs timer to local storage,
        //get timer from local storage and create content to top right
        //displays first question (on a new HTML page?)
        //textCreate first title,
        //text create buttons so the answers pull from the choices array,
        
Step 3a: When choice button is clicked,
        //move questions array forward 1 and 
        //write next title 
        //write next choices as button list
        //timer continues countdown

Step 3b: When choice button is clicked,
        //check if value of index of choice selected is same as answer 
        //evaluate it to true or false
        //append (?) the answer in a true/false alert on the next question in the array

Step 3c: When choice button is clicked,
        //check if value of index of choice selected is same as answer
        //if wrong, assign 0 point, subtract 15 seconds
        //if correct, add 10 points

Step 4: Build final score html 
        //"All Done" header    
        //write final score as text at top
        //include input field to "Enter initials:"
        //include submit button 
        //when submit is clicked,
                //send users to high scores page
                //send intitials-score to local storage        

Step 5: Build page to return initials and final score
        //Header is "HighSchores"
        //Get intitials-score data from local storage on load 
        //button to go back to beginning
        //button to clear high scores
        //link to this page from from nav bar on each html page
