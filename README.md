## HTML

There are two index pages created using a combination of HTML, CSS and bootstrap. Index.html holds three containers: 1) to start the quiz, 2) to hold the question array, and three to display the final scores and allow the user to submit and store their score. HighScores.html retrieves the scores from local storage and allows users to clear highscores and return to the stat of the quiz.

## Javascript

The Javascript relies on event listeners to modify the html dynamically based on user interaction. The quesitons are saved in a separate javascript file. Working on loading new scripts with new questions dynamically to the front page. No JQuery was used.
